# AMC-Annual-Maintenance-Contract-Analysis-Dashboard

üöÄ Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of AMC (Annual Maintenance Contracts), focusing on cost savings, expiring contracts, vendor performance, and high-cost locations. The dataset was created from scratch, and the project was built end-to-end, covering data modeling, visualization, and business problem-solving.

üéØ Key Business Problems Solved
‚úÖ Tracking Expiring Contracts ‚Äì Preventing service disruptions by identifying contracts that require renewal.
‚úÖ Cost Optimization ‚Äì Identifying potential savings by optimizing vendor contracts and maintenance costs.
‚úÖ Vendor Performance Analysis ‚Äì Identifying high-risk vendors contributing to cost overruns.
‚úÖ Location-Based Spend Analysis ‚Äì Understanding which plant locations have the highest AMC spend and need resource reallocation.


üîπ Key Metrics & KPIs (DAX Measures Used)
Total AMC Value = ‚Çπ500 Crores

Expiring Contracts Valuation = ‚Çπ431 Million

Potential Cost Savings = ‚Çπ771 Million

Top 5 High-Cost Vendors ‚Äì Identifies vendors with the highest AMC spend.

PO Status Breakdown ‚Äì Active vs. Expired contracts.

Annual AMC Spend Trend ‚Äì Year-over-year analysis of AMC expenses.

üîπ Three Key Insights from the Dashboard
1Ô∏è‚É£ Expiring Contracts Pose a Major Risk
Total Expiring Contracts: ‚Çπ431 million

A significant portion of AMC contracts are near expiry, which means potential operational disruptions if not renewed.

Action Plan:

Prioritize high-value contracts for renewal.

Identify alternative vendors in case of non-renewals.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Optimization Can Save ‚Çπ771 Million
Your analysis shows that potential cost savings of ‚Çπ771 million exist by optimizing vendor selection and contract negotiations.

High-cost vendors contribute the most to AMC spend‚Äîrenegotiating with them can reduce expenses.

Action Plan:

Reassess vendor pricing models.

Leverage bulk discounts or alternative sourcing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Plant Locations Drive 80% of AMC Spend
A few plant locations contribute to the majority of AMC expenses.

Trend: Higher AMC value = Higher maintenance cost.

Action Plan:

Assess whether specific locations need cost-cutting.

Reallocate resources to balance maintenance across regions.

üîπ How the Business Problem is Solved
Improved Decision-Making: By tracking expiring contracts, companies can act before disruptions occur.

Cost Savings & Vendor Optimization: Identifying high-risk vendors helps in cost control.

Better Resource Allocation: Pinpointing high-cost locations allows management to adjust spending efficiently.


Orders Table (Fact Table)

Captures business transactions (orders placed by customers).

Contains measurable values like OrderValue, DeliveryTime, and PriceHikeApplied.

Links to dimensions like Customers, Products, and Locations for analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Table (Fact Table)

Stores monetary values related to different revenue streams (e.g., Delivery Fees, Advertising Revenue, Product Sales).

Revenue is an aggregatable metric‚Äîa key characteristic of fact tables.

Can be linked to the Orders Table using OrderID.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Costs Table (Fact Table)

Contains measurable financial data related to order fulfillment (e.g., Fixed Costs, Variable Costs).

Used to calculate profitability by comparing it against revenue.

Can be linked to OrderID for cost analysis per order.
