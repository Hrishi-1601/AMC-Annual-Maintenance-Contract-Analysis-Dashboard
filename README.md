# AMC-Annual-Maintenance-Contract-Analysis-Dashboard

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) using Power BI and SQL Server (DirectQuery) for real-time tracking. The dataset includes a total AMC budget of â‚¹51 Cr, distributed across different business units, vendors, and plant locations. The dashboard provides deep insights into cost allocation, vendor performance, material group spending, and contract efficiency, helping in data-driven decision-making for procurement and financial management.
Key Business Problems Addressed
AMC Cost Optimization â†’ Identifies top-spending plant locations and high-cost vendors to optimize maintenance contracts.
Vendor Performance Analysis â†’ Tracks vendor-wise AMC distribution, helping negotiate better contracts and ensuring on-time service delivery.
Contract Categorization â†’ Analyzes AMC spending across Telecommunications, Marine, Equipment, and Materials, identifying areas for cost reduction.
Real-Time Data Updates â†’ Utilizes SQL Server DirectQuery, ensuring that new AMC contracts, vendors, and cost centers are dynamically updated.
Multi-Currency Tracking â†’ Differentiates contracts in INR vs. USD, aiding in financial planning and currency fluctuation impact analysis.
Data Modeling & Structure
ðŸ›  Fact Tables:
Material Group â†’ Defines AMC contract categories (e.g., Telecom, Marine, Equipment, Materials).
Cost Center (CC) â†’ Allocates AMC expenses to specific departments.
Plant Location â†’ Tracks AMC spending across different geographical plant locations.
ðŸ“‚ Dimension Tables:
Telecommunications, Marine, Equipment, Materials â†’ Store contract details like vendor, PO number, currency, and department allocations.
ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Findings
ðŸ”¹ Top AMC Spending Locations:

Major spend concentrated in Panvel, Ranchi, and Navi Mumbai.
Helps identify cost reduction opportunities by renegotiating maintenance contracts.
ðŸ”¹ Vendor Performance Analysis:

Top vendors: Ross Inc, Abbott PLC, Burke Group.
Vendor-wise spend tracking helps ensure service level agreements (SLAs) are met.
ðŸ”¹ AMC Spend by Category:

Materials & Equipment contracts account for the highest costs, indicating the need for efficient vendor selection.
ðŸ”¹ PO Analysis & Timeliness:

Tracks PO release dates and execution timelines, ensuring maintenance services are renewed on time.
